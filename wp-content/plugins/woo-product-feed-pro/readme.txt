= Fix for WooCommerce structured data bug (Elite version) =
Because of a bug in WooCommerce variable products will get disapproved in Google's Merchant Center. WooCommerce adds the price of the cheapest variable product in the structured data for all variations of a product. Because of this there will be a mismatch between the product price you provide to Google in your Google Shopping product feed and the structured data price on the product landingpage. Google will therefor disapprove the product in its merchant center. You won't be able to advertise on that product in your Google Shopping campaign. Our plugin has a feature that will fix the structured data on variable product pages by adding the correct variable product price in the JSON-LD structured data so Google will approve the variable products you submitted. 

= Add critical Google Shopping Feed fields to your store (Elite version) =
Google requires you to add certain fields to the feed you create for Google Shopping. However not all of the required fields are present in WooCommerce.

Feeds created by our plugin have a high approval rate on products in Google's Merchant center.
